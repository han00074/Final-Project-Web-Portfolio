# Final-Project-Web-Portfolio
this is my final project for MTM6201.
in here i used the bootstrap to grid all the pictures and forms.
own designed the logo and some online pictures.
I finshed these 4 pages use around 7 hours.
the idea for this web is clear and easy to read.
not too much colors all the important part are high light so the reader can easy to find right and important place.
